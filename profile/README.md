Chefies stands for Chef In Emergency Situations. Chefies is an application that leverages Computer Vision and Language Learning Models (LLMs) to generate recipes based on the user's ingredients. Chefies provides recipes, detailed cooking instructions, and facts information, thus encouraging better eating habits.
Chefies aims to minimize food waste while maximizing nutritional intake among economically disadvantaged groups. By leveraging technology to identify and suggest food options based on existing ingredients, Chefies seeks to make a tangible difference in the lives of the people it serves, turning everyday food management into a tool for better health and well-being.
